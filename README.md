# SharePoint Periodic Checks

This repository contains an overview of SharePoint Periodic Checks, checks that need to be
performed on a daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly basis.

I then created a PowerShell script that automates as much of these tasks as possible, so
that performing these checks requires as little time as possible.

The repository consists out of three folders:

1. [PeriodicChecks](https://github.com/ykuijs/SPPeriodicChecks/tree/master/PeriodicChecks): An overview of periodic checks for SharePoint, including template work instructions.
1. [Script](https://github.com/ykuijs/SPPeriodicChecks/tree/master/Script): The PeriodicChecks script that automates many of the SharePoint Periodic Checks.
1. [Documentation](https://github.com/ykuijs/SPPeriodicChecks/tree/master/Documentation): Script documentation and installation manual
